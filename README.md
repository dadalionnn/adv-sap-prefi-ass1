## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).

-Service-oriented architecture (SOA) helps an organizations or business to help their services. It makes manageable for easy reuse and integration. Including standardize service contracts, Composability, and interoperability and etc. 


2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.

-The characteristics are standardizing service contracts from the word itself it expresses the services purpose and capabilities to adhere formal service contracts. Loose Coupling it is minimizing the dependencies to reduce coupling between service contracts. Abstraction it avoids unnecessary information and hide internal logic from outside to prevent any problems. Service reusability is like opposite of abstraction instead of minimizing it maximizes to divide logic into services. Autonomy is promoting reliability and predictability behavioral. To ensure the independence dorm outside Statelessness services that are stateless. Discoverability the service here are containing metadata for human understanding and discovery. Composability it breaks big problem to smaller ones. Lastly is interoperability it uses standards for diverse subscriber use. 

3. Define Microservices.

-. Microservices are distinct from larger architectures by composing a single application from loosely coupled services, as opposes to the lightly integrated nature of larger approaches. 

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.

-Agility and scalability the microservices enable more agile and scalable development by allowing easy update. Cloud-Native Approach can use different stacks for various components, optimizing performance and resource utilization. And Efficient Communication it ensures seamless interaction and coordination between services. 

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.

-The difference of SOA is an enterprise-wide approach focusing on how standardize the communication while microservices architecture is an application-specific and emphasizing the independence and stability. Also, the similarity is they are both improving the software architecture. And they have similarity on service independence, agility, interoperability. The difference is the scope and communication.
